## Running the app locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+ and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krelltunez/dayGLANCE.git
cd dayGLANCE
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. It hot-reloads on save.

Other useful commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Production web build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run build:android` | Build the web bundle for the Android app |

### Android app

The Android app is a WebView shell that loads the bundled web app. To build and install it on a connected device:

```bash
./build-and-install.sh
```

**Prerequisites for Android:**
- Android Studio or the Android SDK command-line tools
- A `keystore.properties` file (copy from `keystore.properties.example` and fill in your signing details)
- Min SDK 26 (Android 8.0), target SDK 35

The web bundle is copied into `dayglance-android/app/src/main/assets/web/` as part of the build.

## Running tests

```bash
npm run test
```

Tests run with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Test files live next to the source files they cover and use the `.test.js` suffix (e.g. `mergeSync.test.js`).

When adding new logic, please add a test file alongside it if the logic is non-trivial (data transformations, sync/merge behaviour, etc.). UI-heavy code doesn't need to be tested exhaustively.

If you're looking for a specific feature, searching for a UI string or function name is faster than browsing linearly. The hooks in `src/hooks/` are named by concern (e.g. `useTaskActions`, `useHabits`, `useCloudSync`) and are a good starting point when tracing a feature end-to-end.

## Making a pull request

1. **Fork the repo** and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-fix-or-feature
   ```

2. **Keep changes focused.** One logical change per PR makes review much easier. If you find an unrelated bug while working, open a separate issue or PR for it.

3. **Test your change**: run `npm run test` and make sure nothing is broken. If you're touching the Android widget, build and check it on a real device or emulator if you can.

4. **Write a clear PR description.** Explain *what* changed and *why*, not just what the code does. If it fixes a bug, link the issue.

5. **Don't sweat perfection.** If you're unsure about something, open the PR as a draft and ask. We'd rather see a rough PR than no PR.

### Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style. The project uses standard React/JSX conventions and Tailwind for styling.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless necessary, since the bundle size matters on mobile.
- No em dashes in user-facing copy (UI strings, docs, READMEs). Commit messages and PR descriptions are fine.
- Plain text only in AI prompt responses, with no markdown or emojis (see `ai-prompts.js` for examples).
- Widget layouts use `sp` units for text and `dp` for spacing. Minimum text size is `11sp`.

## Reporting security issues

Please do **not** file public issues for security vulnerabilities. Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/krelltunez/dayGLANCE/security/advisories/new) instead, which sends the report directly to maintainers without exposing it publicly. This applies to anything that could compromise user data: sync credential leaks, encryption flaws, XSS, etc.

For non-sensitive bugs, use the public issue tracker as described below.

---

## Reporting bugs

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/krelltunez/dayGLANCE/issues) and include:

- **What you expected** to happen
- **What actually happened** (error message, screenshot, or screen recording if relevant)
- **Steps to reproduce**: the more specific, the better
- **Environment:** browser/OS, or Android version and device if it's an Android-specific issue

If you're not sure whether something is a bug or by design, open an issue anyway and we'll figure it out together.
