## Why dayGLANCE?

Most planners either lock your data in someone else's cloud or lack the polish of commercial apps. dayGLANCE gives you both: **a rich, intuitive planning experience** you can use right away at [dayglance.app](https://dayglance.app), or deploy on your own infrastructure. Even on the hosted version, your data never leaves your machine — everything is stored locally in your browser. Optionally sync across devices through your own Nextcloud or generic WebDAV server, and work offline as a full PWA. A native Android app is now available (see below)!

## Features

### The Glance Panel

The heart of the app. The Glance panel gives you an intelligent, real-time snapshot of your day — no scrolling through a calendar required. It shows your full agenda with color-coded tasks, a "now" marker that tracks where you are in the day and how much free time you have, overdue tasks that need attention, and today's routines.

### Visual Time-Blocking

Drag and drop tasks onto a 24-hour timeline to plan your day. Resize tasks by dragging their edges and move them between time slots. Filter the timeline by `#tags` to focus on what matters. Supports multi-day views (1, 2, or 3 days) depending on screen size.

### Smart Inbox

Capture tasks as they come to mind without worrying about when to do them. Prioritize with three priority levels, filter by priority, and drag tasks to the timeline when you're ready to commit.

### Recurring Tasks & Routines

Set tasks to repeat daily, weekly on specific days, monthly, or on custom intervals. Edit a single occurrence or the entire series. Build daily **Routines** — reusable task templates for each day of the week that you drag onto the timeline with one gesture.

### Focus Mode

A built-in Pomodoro-style timer with customizable work, short break, and long break durations. Associate a timer session with a specific task and mark it complete when you're done. Keeps your screen awake during focus sessions. On mobile, Focus Mode goes fully immersive — enabling Do Not Disturb, locking to portrait, and expanding the notes/subtasks panel to fill the screen.

### Daily Summary & Statistics

Track your productivity with a daily dashboard: tasks completed, completion rate ring, time planned vs. time spent, and focus time logged. Tap the habit ring row to see a popup summary of the prior day's habit completion. An all-time statistics view shows lifetime trends, averages, and streaks.

### Weekly Review

End each week with a guided review. See your weekly stats, reflect with built-in prompts, and plan ahead. Set a configurable weekly reminder so you never skip a review.

### Calendar Sync & Import

Import events from **iCal, Google Calendar, or Nextcloud** calendar URLs. Imported events appear color-coded on your timeline alongside your tasks, refreshing automatically every 15 minutes.

### Cloud Sync

Sync your entire planner across devices via WebDAV. dayGLANCE supports **Nextcloud** and any **generic WebDAV** server (e.g. Hetzner Storage Box, Synology, Seafile, Radicale). The smart merge engine resolves conflicts at the task level using timestamps — not last-write-wins — so simultaneous edits from two devices won't clobber each other.

### Auto-Backup

Automatic local and remote backups with configurable frequency (hourly, daily, weekly) and retention policies. Restore from any backup with one click. Remote backups are stored on your WebDAV server (Nextcloud, generic WebDAV, etc.).

### Daily Notes

Attach freeform notes to any day for journaling, reflections, or quick references. Notes sync across devices alongside your tasks.

### Dark Mode

A full dark theme that respects your preference across sessions. Every component is theme-aware, including the custom scrollbars and mobile status bar.

### Spotlight Search

Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K`) to instantly search across all tasks — scheduled, inbox, recurring, and even deleted. Results highlight matching text and let you jump straight to the task.

### Notifications & Reminders

Configurable reminders for calendar events, scheduled tasks, all-day tasks, and recurring tasks. Choose to be notified 15, 10, or 5 minutes before, at the start, or at the end. Supports both in-app toasts and native browser notifications.

### Tags & Filtering

Add `#tags` to any task title. Filter your view by one or more tags, toggle untagged tasks on and off, and get autocomplete suggestions as you type.

### Recycle Bin & Undo/Redo

Deleted tasks go to a recycle bin for easy recovery. A full undo/redo stack lets you reverse any action — task creation, edits, moves, completions, and deletions — with `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y`.

### Weather & Daily Content

See current weather conditions, temperature, and a 5-day forecast in the header (by zip code). A rotating panel cycles through dad jokes, fun facts, inspirational quotes, and "this day in history" moments.

### Responsive Across Every Device

dayGLANCE adapts its layout and interactions per device:

- **Desktop**: Multi-day timeline, sidebar with inbox and stats, hover states, mouse drag-and-drop, task resizing
- **Tablet**: Tabbed side panel (Glance | Inbox), floating action buttons, touch-optimized spacing
- **Phone**: Tab-based navigation, swipe gestures to schedule tasks, long-press to drag on the timeline, bottom sheets for modals

| 3-Column (Wide Desktop) | 2-Column (Medium) | 1-Column (Narrow) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| ![3-Column Layout](screenshots/desktop-3col.png) | ![2-Column Layout](screenshots/desktop-2col.png) | ![1-Column Layout](screenshots/desktop-1col.png) |

### Progressive Web App

Install dayGLANCE on any device — desktop, tablet, or phone — for a native app-like experience. Works fully offline after first load with service worker caching. Auto-updates when a new version is deployed.

### Obsidian Integration

Sync tasks and daily notes with your **Obsidian vault** via the Obsidian Local REST API plugin. Scheduled tasks with `[[wikilinks]]` link directly back to notes in your vault — tap the link icon in any task title to open the note. Supports reading and writing all Obsidian task formats, duration ranges (`HH:MM-HH:MM`), moves, rescheduling, and title edits. Daily notes sync bidirectionally. Configure vault connection in **Settings > Obsidian**.

### AI Assistant

An optional AI layer (powered by any OpenAI-compatible API) surfaces suggestions throughout the day:

- **AI voice assistant** - create tasks or manipulate existing ones, all via natural language
- **Frame nudge** — when a time block is active, the Glance panel suggests a specific task to work on
- **Duration & tag estimates** — AI pre-fills likely duration and tags when you create a task
- **Subtask generation** — generate a subtask list from the notes panel or task context menu
- **End-of-day rescheduling** — review incomplete tasks and move them forward with AI-suggested times
- **Evening reflection** — a guided end-of-day prompt to capture wins and plan tomorrow

Enable AI features in **Settings > AI** and enter your API key and endpoint.

### Android App

A native Android wrapper is available as an APK download from the [Releases](https://github.com/krelltunez/dayglance/releases) page. It ships the full web app in a WebView with native enhancements:

- **Home screen widget** — live view of your current frame and upcoming tasks, with a manual refresh button
- **Obsidian deep links** — tap `[[wikilinks]]` to open notes directly in the Obsidian Android app
- **Background notifications** — task and event reminders fire reliably even when the app is closed
- **Immersive Focus Mode** — full-screen timer with automatic Do Not Disturb and portrait lock
- **Calendar integration** — read-only access to your Android calendar; events appear on the timeline
- **Theme-aware status bar** — status bar icons match the app's light/dark theme

### Getting Started Checklist

A built-in onboarding flow guides new users through the app's features: adding tasks, using drag-and-drop, setting priorities, configuring sync, and more. Tracks progress and unlocks features as you explore.

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

No build required. Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  dayglance:
    image: ghcr.io/krelltunez/dayglance:latest
    container_name: dayglance
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "6767:80"
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:6767`.

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krelltunez/day-planner.git
cd day-planner
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser. To build for production: `npm run build`.

### Production Deployment

1. Run the Docker container on your server (see above).

2. Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Caddy) for HTTPS:

   ```caddy
   dayglance.yourdomain.com {
       reverse_proxy localhost:6767
   }
   ```

3. Access your instance at `https://dayglance.yourdomain.com`.

## Cloud Sync Setup

dayGLANCE syncs via WebDAV and supports **Nextcloud** and any **generic WebDAV** server. To configure:

1. Open **Settings > Cloud Sync** in dayGLANCE.
2. Choose your provider (Nextcloud or Generic WebDAV).
3. Enter your WebDAV URL and credentials.
4. Sync runs automatically every 15 minutes, or trigger it manually.

The sync engine merges at the task level, so edits made on different devices to different tasks will be combined cleanly. When the same task is edited on two devices, the most recent edit wins.

---

## Calendar Import

Import events from any iCal-compatible source:

1. Open **Settings** > **Calendar Import**.
2. Paste your calendar URL (Google Calendar, Nextcloud, iCal, etc.).
3. Events appear on your timeline, refreshing every 15 minutes.
