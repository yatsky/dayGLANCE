## Architecture approach

The iOS app follows the exact same pattern as Android: a **WKWebView shell** loading the bundled React SPA from local assets, with Swift bridge objects injected into the JavaScript context to mirror `window.DayGlanceNative` and `window.DayGlanceObsidian`.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              React SPA (same web build)              │
│   native.js detects iOS bridge, degrades on PWA     │
└────────────┬──────────────────────┬─────────────────┘
             │ window.DayGlanceNative│ window.DayGlanceObsidian
    ┌────────▼────────┐     ┌────────▼────────┐
    │  Swift NativeBridge  │     │ Swift ObsidianBridge │
    │  (WKScriptMessageHandler) │ (WKScriptMessageHandler) │
    └────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
             │                       │
   ┌─────────▼─────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  EventKit · HealthKit · UNUserNotifications    │
   │  URLSession · AVAudioRecorder · WidgetKit      │
   │  App Intents · ActivityKit · UIImpactFeedback  │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The web build gets a sibling `vite.config.ios.js` (identical to `vite.config.android.js` — relative base path, no Vercel telemetry, no crossorigin attributes) outputting to `dayglance-ios/DayGlance/Resources/web/`.

The JS bridge communication differs slightly: Android uses synchronous `JavascriptInterface` calls that return strings directly, while WKWebView requires async message passing. The cleanest approach is to keep the same synchronous-looking JS API by using `WKWebView.evaluateJavaScript` to post return values back, with a small promise wrapper on the JS side. Alternatively, use `WKURLSchemeHandler` for truly synchronous responses — that approach is simpler for the existing call sites.

## What transfers for free

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| All React UI in `App.jsx` | No changes needed |
| `src/native.js` bridge wrappers | Minor additions (see below) |
| `src/obsidian.js` markdown parser | No changes needed |
| `src/mergeSync.js` WebDAV engine | No changes needed |
| `src/ai.js` / AI features | No changes needed |
| `vite.config.android.js` approach | Clone for iOS |
| WebDAV sync | Works via `URLSession` HTTP bridge |
| TRMNL integration | No changes needed |
| localStorage data model | WKWebView uses same Web Storage API |

---

## macOS ↔ iOS sync (iCloud)

Both the macOS (Electron) and iOS apps can sync automatically via a shared iCloud ubiquity container — zero user configuration required beyond being signed into the same Apple ID on both devices. WebDAV remains available alongside iCloud for users who also sync with Android or other platforms.

### Mechanism

The app's data model lives in `localStorage` inside the webview. iCloud sync serialises this to a single JSON file in a shared iCloud container, using the same merge strategy as the existing `mergeSync.js` WebDAV engine (timestamp-per-item, last-write-wins per field).

```
┌──────────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────┐
│  macOS (Electron)        │         │  iOS (WKWebView shell)   │
│                          │         │                          │
│  Electron main process   │         │  CloudSyncBridge.swift   │
│  icloud-sync.ts          │◄───────►│  NSMetadataQuery watch   │
│  fs.watch on container   │         │  FileManager ubiquity    │
│                          │  iCloud │                          │
│  IPC: icloud:read/write  │  Drive  │  nativeGetCloudData()    │
│  → renderer mergeSync    │         │  nativeSetCloudData()    │
└──────────────────────────┘         └──────────────────────────┘
              │                                   │
              └──────────── iCloud container ─────┘
                   iCloud.com.dayglance.app
                   Documents/dayglance-data.json
```

### macOS side (Electron)

Electron apps can access iCloud Drive once the app holds the correct entitlements:

- `com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers` → `["iCloud.com.dayglance.app"]`
- `com.apple.developer.ubiquity-kvstore-identifier` → `$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)com.dayglance.app`

The container path is predictable: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~dayglance~app/Documents/dayglance-data.json`. A new `electron/icloud-sync.ts` module:

1. Checks whether the path exists and iCloud Drive is available (the entitlement is present and the user is signed in).
2. Reads the file on startup and sends the data to the renderer via `icloud:data` IPC.
3. Watches the file with `fs.watch` for remote changes (iOS writing while the Mac app is open) and re-sends via IPC.
4. Exposes an `icloud:write` IPC handler the renderer calls after any local mutation, writing the merged JSON back to the container file.

`icloudSyncAvailable()` returns `false` gracefully if the entitlement is missing, iCloud is disabled, or the platform is not macOS — no error surfaces to the user.

### iOS side (Swift)

A new `CloudSyncBridge.swift` exposes two bridge calls:

| JS call | Swift action |
|---|---|
| `nativeGetCloudData()` | Reads `dayglance-data.json` from the ubiquity container; returns JSON string or `null` |
| `nativeSetCloudData(json)` | Writes JSON string to the ubiquity container; iCloud propagates to macOS automatically |
| `nativeIsCloudSyncAvailable()` | Returns `true` if `ubiquityIdentityToken` is non-nil (user is signed into iCloud) |

On app launch, `CloudSyncBridge` starts an `NSMetadataQuery` scoped to `NSMetadataQueryUbiquitousDocumentsScope` watching for changes to `dayglance-data.json`. When the query fires (macOS wrote a change), the bridge calls `evaluateJavaScript` on the webview to trigger a merge in the web layer — same path as WebDAV's `mergeSync.js` reconcile.

### Merge strategy

No new merge logic is needed. The existing `mergeSync.js` already handles the read-merge-write cycle. iCloud sync is just a new transport that calls into the same merge function:

```
readCloudData() → mergeSync.merge(local, remote) → writeCloudData(merged)
```

Conflicts (both sides wrote while offline) are resolved identically to WebDAV: most-recent `updatedAt` timestamp per item wins. The merged result is written back so both sides converge.

### Coexistence with WebDAV

iCloud and WebDAV sync are independent providers and can both be active:

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Apple-only (Mac + iPhone) | iCloud only — no config needed |
| Cross-platform (+ Android) | WebDAV for Android; iCloud for Mac ↔ iPhone |
| Both configured | iCloud syncs Apple devices continuously; WebDAV syncs on demand with Android/other |

iCloud sync is enabled by default (if available) and requires no settings UI. WebDAV remains opt-in via the existing settings screen.

### Entitlements + App Store requirements

- iCloud capability must be enabled in the App Store Connect record for both the macOS and iOS apps.
- The iCloud container (`iCloud.com.dayglance.app`) is registered once in the Apple Developer portal and shared by both apps.
- The macOS Electron app's `entitlements.plist` (already used for notarization) gets the two iCloud keys added.
- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` (required for iOS 17+ App Store) must declare use of `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryFileTimestamp` for the container file access.

## Bridge parity: Android → iOS

Each Android bridge class gets a Swift equivalent. All method signatures exposed to JS remain identical so `native.js` needs no call-site changes — only the bridge detection logic changes.

| Android (Kotlin) | iOS (Swift) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NativeBridge.kt` | `NativeBridge.swift` | Top-level WKScriptMessageHandler dispatcher |
| `HealthBridge.kt` | `HealthBridge.swift` | HealthKit instead of Health Connect; same JSON shape |
| `CalendarBridge.kt` | `CalendarBridge.swift` | EventKit instead of CalendarProvider |
| `NotificationBridge.kt` | `NotificationBridge.swift` | UNUserNotificationCenter; see notes below |
| `HttpBridge.kt` | `HttpBridge.swift` | URLSession; straightforward |
| `ObsidianBridge.kt` | `ObsidianBridge.swift` | Security-scoped bookmarks; see notes below |
| `FocusBridge.kt` | ~~Not implemented~~ | DND/Focus control not available to iOS apps |
| `AudioBridge` (in MainActivity) | `AudioBridge.swift` | AVAudioRecorder; same base64 MP4 output |

### HealthKit vs Health Connect

HealthKit is a direct drop-in for the steps + sleep data we already read, and it's richer:

- `HKStatisticsQuery` for step count → same `{ steps, goal }` JSON
- `HKCategoryTypeIdentifier.sleepAnalysis` for sleep stages → same `{ duration, stages }` JSON
- **Bonus data available**: HRV, resting heart rate, blood oxygen, respiratory rate — can be surfaced in a richer sleep card without any web-layer changes beyond reading the extra fields

Health Connect on Android requires the Health Connect app to be installed; HealthKit is built into every iPhone. Permission flow is simpler.

### EventKit vs CalendarProvider

EventKit maps cleanly to the existing `getEvents` / `createEvent` / `updateEvent` / `deleteEvent` API. One difference: Android can silently read all synced calendars; iOS requires the user to grant `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` permission first, which is functionally the same user-visible experience.

### UNUserNotificationCenter vs AlarmManager

`UNUserNotificationCenter` with `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger` handles scheduled reminders. The key differences:

- **No boot receiver needed**: iOS restores scheduled notifications automatically after restart.
- **No exact-alarm permission dialog**: iOS notifications just work once `requestAuthorization` is granted.
- **Less precise**: iOS can delay notifications by a few minutes in low-power mode. Acceptable for task reminders.
- **Notification action buttons** (Snooze, Mark Complete): fully supported via `UNNotificationAction` / `UNNotificationCategory`. The pending-action polling pattern (`nativeGetPendingAction`) works the same — store the action in UserDefaults, read it on next app foreground.
- **Snooze**: can use `UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger` for 15-minute reschedule, same as Android.

### Obsidian / file access on iOS

Obsidian on iOS stores vaults in iCloud Drive (`/private/var/mobile/Library/Mobile Documents/md~obsidian/Documents/<vault>/`) or in the Obsidian app's local sandbox. The recommended approach:

1. Use `UIDocumentPickerViewController` (equivalent of Android's SAF picker) for the user to select their vault folder once.
2. Save a **security-scoped bookmark** (`URL.bookmarkData(options: .withSecurityScope)`) in UserDefaults — this is the iOS equivalent of SAF persistent URI permissions and survives app restarts.
3. Call `url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` / `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` around each read/write.

This works for iCloud Drive vaults. Local-only vaults inside the Obsidian app sandbox are not accessible (iOS app sandboxing), but iCloud vaults are accessible from the Files app picker, which covers most Obsidian iOS users. A settings screen (equivalent to `SettingsActivity`) is needed for the one-time vault selection.

---

## Feature delta: what changes on iOS

### Focus mode (DND)

iOS provides no API for an app to enable/disable the system Focus mode or Do Not Disturb. The `nativeEnterFocusMode` / `nativeExitFocusMode` / `nativeIsDndPermissionGranted` bridge calls will return `null` / `false` on iOS.

In `App.jsx`, the focus mode UI should gracefully degrade: hide the "Enable DND" toggle on iOS (it can detect platform via the bridge detection logic), but still support the immersive full-screen mode using WKWebView's `setValue(true, forKey: "fullscreenEnabled")` and hiding the status bar via `prefersStatusBarHidden`.

### Home screen widget

Android ships three widget types: **Up Next**, **Goal**, and **Project**. The iOS equivalents mirror these using WidgetKit static SwiftUI snapshots (WidgetKit does not support scrollable lists).

| Widget | Small (2×2) | Medium (2×4) | Large (4×4) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Up Next** | Next task/event + time | Up to 5 upcoming items | Up to 10 upcoming items |
| **Goal** | Goal name + progress ring | Goal name + progress bar + streak | Goal details + recent history |
| **Project** | Project name + % complete | Project name + next 3 tasks | Project name + full task list |

All three widgets read from an **App Group shared container** (`UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.com.dayglance.app")`), the iOS equivalent of Android's `SharedDataStore`. The web layer writes snapshot JSON via a `nativeUpdateWidgetSnapshot(type, json)` bridge call (Up Next, Goal, and Project each get their own snapshot key). A `BGAppRefreshTask` refreshes snapshots every 15–30 minutes, same as `WorkManager` on Android.

**Note**: iOS 17+ WidgetKit interactive widgets (buttons) make habit check-off or task complete directly from the widget feasible — same capability already on Android — as a follow-on to the initial static implementation.

### iPad layout (required at launch)

iPad is a day-one target. The existing React UI scales well and the `max-w-*` Tailwind constraints already handle wider viewports acceptably. Required work:

- `UIRequiresFullScreen = false` in Info.plist — iPad apps must support split view and slide-over or Apple will reject them
- All orientations enabled on iPad (`UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad`)
- System keyboard shortcut overlay (iPadOS shows ⌘-key cheatsheet on long-press — no code needed, just ensure the app doesn't suppress it)
- Swift injects `window.isIPad = true` flag at launch; web layer can use this for any layout adjustments if the default scaling looks off in practice

iPad Lock Screen widgets (iPadOS 17+) have much more horizontal space than iPhone — the medium widget could show a full day agenda column, added in Phase 12.

---

## iOS-exclusive features

These have no Android equivalent and represent genuine differentiators for the iOS version.

### 1. Siri Shortcuts / App Intents

With the App Intents framework (iOS 16+), dayGLANCE can expose intents that users invoke by voice or via Shortcuts:

- "Add task to dayGLANCE" — opens the app to the add-task sheet with pre-filled text
- "What's on my agenda today?" — Siri reads back the next 3 scheduled items
- "Start focus session" — launches the focus mode timer directly

Implementation: define `AppIntent` conforming structs in Swift. The "open with parameter" intents use `ForegroundContinuableIntent` to hand off to the app. The "read agenda" intent can be fully headless using the shared App Group data.

### 2. Live Activities (Dynamic Island / Lock Screen)

ActivityKit (iOS 16.2+) lets dayGLANCE push a persistent live update to the Dynamic Island (iPhone 14 Pro+) and the Lock Screen during a focus session or while a task is in progress.

Use cases:
- **Focus session**: countdown timer visible at a glance without unlocking the phone, matching the in-app focus mode experience
- **Next task**: show the title and time of the next scheduled task while the phone is locked

Implementation: define an `ActivityAttributes` struct with the session state (time remaining, task title). The Swift bridge calls `Activity<DayGlanceAttributes>.request(...)` when focus mode starts and `activity.end(...)` when it ends. The web layer triggers this via a new `nativeStartLiveActivity(title, durationSeconds)` bridge call.

### 3. Focus Filters (iOS 16+)

Apps can register a `SetFocusFilterIntent` that the system calls when the user switches Focus modes (Work, Personal, Sleep, etc.). dayGLANCE could:

- Show only work calendars during Work Focus
- Hide personal tasks / show only work tasks during Work Focus
- Suppress all notifications during Sleep Focus (complementary to the user's own DND)

Implementation: an `AppFocusFilterIntent` struct in Swift stores the user's preference per Focus mode. When the system activates a Focus, the intent fires and writes to the App Group container; the web app reads this flag on next foreground.

### 4. StandBy mode (iOS 17+, iPhone only)

When an iPhone is charging in landscape orientation, iOS shows StandBy. Apps can provide a WidgetKit widget that renders full-screen in StandBy.

A large WidgetKit widget variant (the full-width StandBy size) could show:
- Current time (large)
- Today's remaining agenda items
- Active focus session countdown if running

This is implemented as an additional widget size/configuration in the same WidgetKit extension — no separate code path needed beyond a new SwiftUI view for the large variant.

### 5. Haptic feedback

iOS's `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` and `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator` support distinct haptic patterns. Proposed mapping:

| Action | Haptic |
|---|---|
| Task complete | `.success` (notification feedback) |
| Habit logged | `.medium` impact |
| Focus session start | `.heavy` impact |
| Reminder fires | `.warning` (notification feedback) |
| Task deleted | `.light` impact |

Implementation: `nativeHaptic(type: string)` bridge call, called from App.jsx at existing action points. No-op on Android (or uses `Vibrator` if desired as a follow-up).

### 6. Share Extension

An iOS Share Extension lets users share text or URLs from any app (Safari, Notes, Reminders, etc.) directly into dayGLANCE as a new task. The extension writes to the App Group container; on next app open, dayGLANCE reads it and pre-populates the add-task sheet.

---

## Phased implementation plan

### Phase 1 — Xcode project shell + WebView (Foundation)

- Create `dayglance-ios/` Xcode project (Swift, SwiftUI app lifecycle)
- `ContentView` hosts a `WKWebView` loading requests via `WKURLSchemeHandler` (chosen over promise-wrapper approach: keeps all `native.js` call sites synchronous-looking with no changes)
- `vite.config.ios.js` (clone of android config) outputting to `dayglance-ios/DayGlance/Resources/web/`
- Build script: `npm run build:ios` → Vite build → copy assets → open Xcode
- Status bar colour matching + safe area insets; portrait lock on iPhone, all orientations on iPad
- iPad split view / multitasking support (`UIRequiresFullScreen = false`); system keyboard shortcut overlay
- Bridge detection: inject `window.DayGlanceIOS = true` so `native.js` can distinguish iOS from Android
- App icon, launch screen, bundle ID (`com.dayglance.app`)

**Status: ✅ Complete.** Minor gap: status bar text colour is static (`UIStatusBarStyleDefault`) — does not flip to white in dark mode. Cosmetic; can be addressed in Phase 12 polish.

### Phase 2 — Health (HealthKit)

- `HealthBridge.swift`: steps via `HKStatisticsQuery`, sleep via `HKSampleQuery`
- `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` in Info.plist
- Same JSON response shape as Android (`{ steps, goal }`, `{ duration, stages, ... }`)
- Expose bonus fields (HRV, resting HR) as optional keys — web layer ignores unknown keys today, can surface them later

**Status: ✅ Complete.** HRV and resting HR are pre-declared in `readTypes` (future-proofed for when the web layer surfaces them).

### Phase 3 — Calendar (EventKit)

- `CalendarBridge.swift`: `getCalendars`, `getEvents`, `createEvent`, `updateEvent`, `deleteEvent`
- `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` + `NSCalendarsWriteOnlyAccessUsageDescription`
- Identical JSON contract to Android

**Status: ✅ Complete.** `NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription` added (required for iOS 17+ `requestFullAccessToEvents`). `getCalendarAuthStatus` debug bridge method also added. Device Calendars filter UI now shown on iOS (was previously Android-only).

### Phase 4 — Notifications

- `NotificationBridge.swift`: `scheduleReminder`, `cancelReminder`, `showNotification`, `showTaskNotification`, `syncReminders`, `getPendingAction`
- `UNUserNotificationCenter` with Snooze + Mark Complete action categories
- `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger` for scheduled reminders
- `UNNotificationServiceExtension` not needed — action handling in `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`
- No boot receiver needed (iOS restores notifications automatically)

**Status: ✅ Complete.** All six bridge methods implemented. Snooze + Mark Complete action categories registered at launch via `AppDelegate`. `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` wired for foreground banner presentation and action handling.

### Phase 5 — File access + Obsidian

- `ObsidianBridge.swift`: `getDailyNote`, `listNotes`, `appendToNote`, `getTasksFromNote`, `writeDailyNote`, `isVaultConfigured`, `getVaultConfig`
- `UIDocumentPickerViewController` for one-time vault selection
- Security-scoped bookmarks in `UserDefaults` (App Group container for widget access too)
- Settings screen (`SettingsViewController` or SwiftUI sheet) for vault path display + re-pick
- `NSFileProviderDomainIdentifier` not needed — direct file URL access is sufficient

**Status: ✅ Complete.** Implemented methods exceed the spec: also includes `getAllDailyNotes` (single-round-trip batch read), `getNote`, `writeNote`, `buildNoteIndex`, `openNote` (obsidian:// URI), `clearVault`, and `setVaultSettings`. The last one is a notable addition: Android persists folder/pattern via `SettingsActivity`; iOS has no equivalent, so a `setVaultSettings(folder, pattern, newNotesFolder)` bridge call was added, called from an `App.jsx` effect whenever `obsidianConfig` changes, keeping `UserDefaults` in sync with the web settings UI.

**Deferred to Phase 10**: bookmarks are currently stored in `UserDefaults.standard`; they need migrating to the App Group container (`group.com.dayglance.app`) so the WidgetKit extension can access the vault.

**isNativeAndroid → isNativeApp audit also completed**: 21 guards across 8 files updated so iOS behaves identically to Android everywhere it should (calendar sync configuration, cloud sync dedup, settings UI, reminder notifications, native event editing, etc.). Guards intentionally kept as `isNativeAndroid()`: status bar appearance, `notifyNativeReady` splash callback, `nativeShareFile`, `nativeHttpRequest` ICS fetch, DnD permission checks, tab bar safe-area padding, and the SettingsModal Obsidian section (hidden on iOS — covered by `MobileSettingsPanel`).

### Phase 6 — HTTP bridge + WebDAV

- `HttpBridge.swift`: `URLSession` based, same `{ status, ok, body }` JSON response
- `NSAppTransportSecurity` → `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads: true` (or whitelist known WebDAV hosts)
- Verify WebDAV sync end-to-end on iOS

### Phase 7 — iCloud sync (macOS ↔ iOS)

- Register `iCloud.com.dayglance.app` container in Apple Developer portal
- **iOS**: `CloudSyncBridge.swift` — `nativeGetCloudData()`, `nativeSetCloudData(json)`, `nativeIsCloudSyncAvailable()`; `NSMetadataQuery` watch for remote changes
- **macOS (Electron)**: `electron/icloud-sync.ts` — file read/write at ubiquity container path; `fs.watch` for remote changes; `icloud:read` / `icloud:write` IPC handlers
- Add iCloud entitlements to macOS `entitlements.plist` (`icloud-container-identifiers`, `ubiquity-kvstore-identifier`)
- Wire renderer: on `icloud:data` IPC event, call `mergeSync.merge(local, remote)` and write merged result back
- `nativeIsCloudSyncAvailable()` degrades gracefully (returns `false`) when iCloud is unavailable
- Add `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryFileTimestamp` to `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
- Enable iCloud capability in App Store Connect for both macOS and iOS app records

### Phase 8 — Audio recording

- `AudioBridge.swift`: `AVAudioRecorder` capturing to `.m4a` (AAC, 16kHz, 32kbps)
- Returns same `data:audio/mp4;base64,...` string as Android
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in Info.plist

### Phase 9 — Subscriptions (StoreKit 2)

StoreKit 2 integration is required on both platforms and unlocks Universal Purchase — one subscription covers both iOS and macOS automatically via Apple's entitlement infrastructure.

**App Store Connect setup (once, before any code)**
- Register one auto-renewable subscription group: "dayGLANCE Pro"
- Two products: `com.dayglance.app.pro.monthly` and `com.dayglance.app.pro.yearly`
- Introductory offer: first period free or discounted (available to first-time subscribers automatically)
- Founder offer: batch of **offer codes** generated in App Store Connect and distributed to early adopters — this is the correct mechanism for a date-gated discount since introductory offers are per-user, not date-gated
- Enable Universal Purchase: link iOS and macOS apps in App Store Connect under the same bundle ID family

**iOS + macOS via RevenueCat**
- **RevenueCat** is used as the subscription management layer across all platforms (iOS, macOS, Android)
- iOS and macOS both use the RevenueCat SDK (`purchases-ios`, which supports macOS 10.13+); Electron's renderer uses the RevenueCat JS/web SDK or calls through to the native SDK via Electron IPC
- RevenueCat maps the App Store subscription products to a single "Pro" entitlement — no raw StoreKit calls needed in app code
- `Purchases.shared.getCustomerInfo()` returns entitlement status; works identically on iOS and macOS
- Purchases, restores, and renewals all go through `Purchases.shared.purchase(package:)` / `Purchases.shared.restorePurchases()`
- Transaction listener and renewal handling managed by RevenueCat SDK — no manual `Transaction.currentEntitlements` loop needed
- RevenueCat dashboard provides customer lookup, manual entitlement grants, and webhook events (subscription started, cancelled, churned) for support and analytics
- Android billing (Google Play) can be added to the same RevenueCat project later with no changes to the web layer
- Free tier covers up to $2,500 MRR; 1% fee above that

**Web layer (`src/subscription.js`)**
- New module wrapping `nativeGetSubscriptionStatus()` / `nativePurchase()` / `nativeRestorePurchases()`
- `useSubscription()` hook returns `{ isPro, loading, purchase, restore }`
- Paywall UI component (shown when a Pro feature is accessed without an active subscription)
- All gated features degrade gracefully in the web layer when `isPro` is false

### Phase 10 — Home screen widgets (WidgetKit)

- New `DayGlanceWidget` WidgetKit extension target
- App Group shared container replaces Android's `SharedDataStore`
- Three widget kinds matching Android: **Up Next**, **Goal**, **Project**
- `nativeUpdateWidgetSnapshot(type, json)` bridge call — one call per widget kind
- SwiftUI views for Small, Medium, and Large sizes per widget kind
- `BGAppRefreshTask` for 15-minute background refresh
- StandBy large-size variant (iOS 17+)
- iOS 16+ interactive widget buttons (task complete, habit check-off) as a stretch goal

### Phase 11 — iOS-exclusive features

- **Siri / App Intents**: "Add task", "Read agenda" intents (`AppIntent` framework)
- **Live Activities**: Focus session countdown in Dynamic Island / Lock Screen (`ActivityKit`)
- **Focus Filters**: Per-system-Focus calendar/task filtering (`SetFocusFilterIntent`)
- **Share Extension**: Receive shared text → create task on next app open
- **Haptics**: `nativeHaptic(type)` bridge call wired to `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`

### Phase 12 — Polish + App Store

- iPad Lock Screen widget (medium/large, iPadOS 17+)
- App Store metadata, screenshots (iPhone 6.7", iPad 13")
- Privacy manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) — required for App Store since iOS 17
- **macOS MAS sandbox audit**: test existing Electron app under MAS sandbox entitlements; fix any file-access, network, or API breakage before submitting macOS to the App Store alongside iOS
- TestFlight beta (iOS + macOS — both platforms support TestFlight under MAS)

## native.js changes

The existing `isNativeAndroid()` check needs a companion for iOS, plus a platform-agnostic helper:

```js
// Add to native.js:

export const isNativeIOS = () =>
  typeof window !== 'undefined' && !!window.DayGlanceIOS;

export const isNativeApp = () => isNativeAndroid() || isNativeIOS();
```

All existing `nativeBridge()` calls already degrade gracefully to `null` when the bridge is absent — no call-site changes needed in `App.jsx`. The only places that need iOS-awareness are:

- **Focus mode UI**: hide the DND toggle on iOS (`isNativeIOS()`)
- **Haptics**: new feature, iOS-only initially
- **Live Activities**: new feature, iOS-only
- **Health extras** (HRV etc.): read optional fields from existing `nativeGetSleep` response
- **iCloud sync**: three new bridge calls available on both iOS and macOS (Electron IPC):

```js
// New bridge calls for iCloud sync:
// nativeIsCloudSyncAvailable() → boolean
// nativeGetCloudData()         → JSON string | null
// nativeSetCloudData(json)     → void

// On iOS these go through CloudSyncBridge.swift.
// On macOS they go through Electron IPC (icloud:available, icloud:read, icloud:write).
// Both call into the existing mergeSync.merge() on the JS side.
export const isCloudSyncAvailable = () =>
  isNativeIOS()
    ? nativeBridge('nativeIsCloudSyncAvailable') === true
    : window.__electronIPC?.icloudAvailable ?? false;
```

---

## Open questions

1. **Obsidian local vaults**: Users with vaults not in iCloud Drive can't use the Obsidian bridge on iOS. Worth a warning in the settings screen, or an alternative (manual import/export of the daily note)?

2. ~~**WKWebView async bridge**~~: **Resolved** — using `WKURLSchemeHandler` for synchronous-looking JS call sites.

3. **TestFlight timing**: Should the iOS beta be gated behind the Android feature set reaching parity (Phases 1–7), or released earlier for testing with a subset of features?

4. ~~**App Store pricing**~~: **Resolved** — auto-renewable subscription (monthly + yearly). Founder discount via App Store Connect offer codes. Universal Purchase links macOS and iOS under one subscription.

5. ~~**iPad as first-class target**~~: **Resolved** — iPad required at launch. Split view / multitasking support added to Phase 1.

6. **iCloud sync conflict window**: If both macOS and iOS are offline simultaneously and make different changes, the merge on reconnect resolves per-item by timestamp. Is last-write-wins per item acceptable, or do we need a richer conflict UI (e.g. "both versions" diff) for any data type?

7. ~~**iCloud sync phase timing**~~: **Resolved** — Phase 6 (HTTP bridge / WebDAV) ships first. Rationale: the iOS half of iCloud sync (`CloudSyncBridge.swift`, `NSMetadataQuery`) doesn't need the HTTP bridge, but the macOS Electron half (`electron/icloud-sync.ts`, entitlements, IPC wiring) is a non-trivial parallel change, and the iCloud container (`iCloud.com.dayglance.app`) must be registered in the Apple Developer portal before any of it is testable. Phase 6 unblocks WebDAV end-to-end testing on device in the meantime. iCloud sync (Phase 7) then follows as a deliberate two-codebase effort once the portal setup is in place. The two sync transports are fully independent and coexist cleanly: iCloud covers Apple-to-Apple zero-config; WebDAV covers cross-platform (Android, Windows, self-hosted).

8. ~~**StoreKit on macOS / Electron**~~: **Resolved** — using RevenueCat across iOS, macOS, and Android. Avoids the MAS sandbox XPC complexity; adds customer dashboard, webhooks, and future Android billing support.

9. **macOS MAS sandbox**: The macOS Electron app has not been tested under App Sandbox entitlements. This is a parallel workstream to the iOS build — sandbox breakage in Obsidian file access, WebDAV, or other APIs needs to be found and fixed before the macOS App Store submission. When should this audit begin relative to the iOS phases?
